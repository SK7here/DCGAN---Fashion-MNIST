# DCGAN-Fashion-MNIST
<b>Fashion MNIST</b> dataset is directly downloaded from <b>tf.keras.datasets</b><br>
Composed of <b>60,000 training images</b> and <b>10,000 test images</b><br>
Dimension of each image is <b>28x28</b><br><br>
To improve DCGAN model performance (use GPU/Colab for these cases)
1. Increase the number of epochs
2. Increase the number of layers for Generator and Discriminator

To use custom images of diferent dimensions
1. Make changes in input size of Discriminator
2. Modify layers in both Generator and Discriminator accordingly
